# Fraud_Detection

Developed a credit card fraud detection system using XGBoost, which has a 91% accuracy rate in detecting valid transactions. I made use of the SimpleImputer module from the popular scikit-learn library to handle the dataset's missing values, ensuring the accuracy and dependability of the data. By using preprocessing techniques, I concentrated on improving the data quality by reducing the number of features from 434 to 232 by correlation analysis. This process lowered the model's dimensionality and increased model effectiveness, resulting in a more streamlined and effective dataset. I was able to correctly identify and choose the most pertinent characteristics by applying feature selection based on correlation analysis, which improved the overall data quality and increased the effectiveness of the fraud detection system.
